# AI-Based Resume Analyzer

## Overview
The AI-Based Resume Analyzer is an innovative tool designed to analyze resumes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It generates a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis for the given resume and identifies grammatical errors, providing actionable feedback for improvement.

- **SWOT Analysis**: Extracts and categorizes key insights into strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
- **Grammar Check**: Identifies and rectifies grammatical errors in the resume.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for uploading resumes and viewing results.
- **Customizable Output**: Allows users to tailor analysis based on job-specific requirements.
